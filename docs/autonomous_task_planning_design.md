# Autonomous Task Planning Design for Atlas

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for autonomous task planning in Atlas, a key component of Phase 8 (Advanced AI Integration). Autonomous task planning enables the AI to independently plan, prioritize, and execute complex tasks without direct user intervention, enhancing productivity and user experience.

## Objectives

- **Independence**: Allow Atlas to autonomously handle task creation, scheduling, and execution based on user goals and context.
- **Adaptability**: Enable the AI to adapt plans dynamically based on changing conditions, user feedback, and learned patterns.
- **Transparency**: Provide users with visibility into planned tasks and the reasoning behind AI decisions.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing modules like Tasks, Chat, and Plugins for a cohesive experience.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure autonomous actions align with user preferences and ethical guidelines.

## Core Components

### 1. Task Planner Agent
   - **Purpose**: A dedicated AI agent responsible for generating and managing task plans.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Analyze user goals, historical data, and current context to create task plans.
     - Break down complex goals into actionable sub-tasks with dependencies and priorities.
     - Schedule tasks based on deadlines, user availability, and resource constraints.
   - **Location**: `agents/task_planner_agent.py`

### 2. Context Analyzer
   - **Purpose**: Extracts and processes contextual information to inform task planning.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Gather data from user interactions, memory systems, and external sources (e.g., calendar, location).
     - Identify user habits, preferences, and current workload to tailor plans.
     - Update context dynamically as new information becomes available.
   - **Integration**: Works closely with `MemoryManager` for historical context and `SelfLearningAgent` for behavior patterns.

### 3. Decision Engine
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates options and makes decisions during task execution.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Use reinforcement learning or heuristic models to choose optimal actions when multiple paths exist.
     - Handle conflicts (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling clashes) by prioritizing based on user-defined rules or learned importance.
     - Log decision rationale for transparency and future learning.
   - **Technology**: Likely based on a lightweight decision tree or contextual bandit model, evolving with user feedback.

### 4. Task Execution Module
   - **Purpose**: Executes planned tasks autonomously using available tools and plugins.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Trigger actions via plugin APIs, internal tools, or simulated user inputs (e.g., sending messages, creating files).
     - Monitor task progress, detect failures, and retry or escalate issues to the user if needed.
     - Report task completion status back to the planner for plan updates.
   - **Integration**: Interfaces with `PluginManager` to access external capabilities.

### 5. User Interface Layer
   - **Purpose**: Provides visibility and control over autonomous tasks to the user.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Display planned tasks, their status, and AI reasoning in the Tasks module.
     - Allow users to approve, modify, or cancel AI-generated plans.
     - Notify users of critical updates or when intervention is required.
   - **Location**: Enhancements to `ui_qt/tasks_module.py`.

## Architecture

- **Central Coordinator**: The `TaskPlannerAgent` acts as the central brain, orchestrating input from the `ContextAnalyzer`, decisions from the `DecisionEngine`, and actions via the `TaskExecutionModule`.
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous feedback from task execution and user interactions feeds back into the planner and self-learning systems for real-time adaptation.
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to be independent, allowing for easy updates or replacement (e.g., swapping decision models).
- **Data Flow**:
  1. User goals or implicit needs are captured via Chat or Tasks modules.
  2. `ContextAnalyzer` enriches the input with situational data.
  3. `TaskPlannerAgent` generates a plan, consulting the `DecisionEngine` for choices.
  4. `TaskExecutionModule` carries out the plan, reporting progress.
  5. User feedback or execution outcomes are stored via `MemoryManager` for learning.

## Learning and Adaptation

- **Initial Model**: Start with rule-based planning (e.g., prioritize by deadline, user-defined importance) to ensure predictability.
- **Progressive Learning**: Incorporate machine learning to optimize planning over time, using data from completed tasks and user satisfaction ratings.
  - Likely approach: Reinforcement Learning where the reward is based on task completion efficiency and user feedback.
- **Personalization**: Leverage `SelfLearningAgent` profiles to tailor planning strategies to individual user styles (e.g., some prefer detailed micro-tasks, others high-level goals).

## Privacy and Ethics

- **User Control**: Users must opt-in to autonomous task planning, with granular control over what types of tasks the AI can handle independently.
- **Data Handling**: Context data used for planning (e.g., calendar, location) must be anonymized or encrypted where possible, adhering to privacy settings.
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Define clear limits on AI actions (e.g., no financial transactions or personal communications without explicit consent).
- **Auditability**: Maintain a log of autonomous decisions and actions for user review, ensuring transparency.

## Integration Points

- **Chat Module**: Capture user goals and implicit tasks from conversations, feed outcomes back as chat updates.
- **Tasks Module**: Primary UI for displaying and managing AI-generated tasks, including approval workflows.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Use plugins as execution arms for tasks requiring external services (e.g., sending emails, querying APIs).
- **Memory System**: Store task history, user preferences, and context for continuity across sessions.

## Performance Goals

- **Planning Latency**: Task plan generation should complete in under 500ms for simple tasks, under 2s for complex multi-step plans.
- **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time status updates during task execution with minimal overhead (<100ms per check).
- **Memory Usage**: Keep memory footprint low by storing only essential planning data, leveraging `MemoryManager` caching.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components (e.g., `TaskPlannerAgent` plan generation, `DecisionEngine` choice logic).
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure seamless interaction between planner, execution, and UI modules.
- **Scenario Tests**: Simulate complex user goals (e.g., "Plan a meeting next week") to verify end-to-end functionality.
- **Edge Cases**: Test failure modes (e.g., plugin unavailable, user overrides plan) and recovery mechanisms.
- **User Simulation**: Use mock user feedback to train and evaluate learning models for planning optimization.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)**
   - Implement `TaskPlannerAgent` with basic rule-based planning.
   - Develop `ContextAnalyzer` for basic user context (e.g., task history, time of day).
   - Create minimal UI in `TasksModule` to display AI plans.

2. **Phase 2: Execution and Decision Making (2-3 weeks)**
   - Build `TaskExecutionModule` to trigger actions via internal APIs and plugins.
   - Add `DecisionEngine` with simple heuristics for conflict resolution.
   - Enhance UI for user approval and modification of plans.

3. **Phase 3: Learning and Adaptation (3-4 weeks)**
   - Integrate reinforcement learning into `TaskPlannerAgent` for plan optimization.
   - Connect with `SelfLearningAgent` for personalized planning strategies.
   - Implement detailed logging for transparency and debugging.

4. **Phase 4: Polish and Testing (2 weeks)**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing (unit, integration, scenario).
   - Optimize performance for latency and memory usage.
   - Finalize ethical guidelines and user control settings.

## Challenges and Mitigations

- **Complexity of Goals**: User goals can be vague or multi-layered. Mitigate by starting with structured task domains (e.g., scheduling, reminders) and iteratively expanding scope based on feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Autonomous actions may fail unpredictably. Implement robust retry mechanisms and user escalation paths.
- **User Trust**: Users may be wary of AI autonomy. Build trust through transparency (explain decisions), control (easy override), and proven reliability (rigorous testing).
- **Resource Constraints**: Planning and execution must not overload system resources. Use efficient algorithms and leverage `MemoryManager` for caching.

## Metrics for Success

- **User Adoption**: Percentage of users opting into autonomous task planning features (>50% target within 3 months).
- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of AI-planned tasks completed without user intervention (>80% target).
- **User Satisfaction**: Average user rating of autonomous task handling (>4 out of 5).
- **Performance**: Meet latency targets for planning and execution under typical workloads.

This design provides a comprehensive framework for autonomous task planning in Atlas, balancing innovation with user control and ethical responsibility. The next steps involve implementing the foundational components and iterating based on testing and user feedback.

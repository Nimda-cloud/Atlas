## Credential Management

- **Never Hardcode Credentials**: API keys, passwords, and other sensitive credentials must never be hardcoded in the source code. Use environment variables or a secure credential vault.
  ```bash
  # Set environment variables (example)
  export ATLAS_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-secure-key-here"
  export ATLAS_MASTER_KEY="your-master-key-here"
  ```
- **Use CredentialManager**: Leverage the `CredentialManager` class from `security.credential_manager` to securely store and retrieve credentials within the application.
  ```python
  from security.credential_manager import CredentialManager
  
  credential_mgr = CredentialManager()
  # Store a credential
  credential_mgr.store_credential("api_key", "your-api-key", "API key for external service")
  # Retrieve a credential
  api_key = credential_mgr.retrieve_credential("api_key")
  ```
- **Rotate Credentials Regularly**: Ensure credentials are rotated periodically and immediately after a suspected breach.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validate All Inputs**: Always validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Use the utilities provided in `ui.input_validation`.
  ```python
  from ui.input_validation import validate_ui_input, sanitize_ui_input
  
  username = input("Enter username: ")
  is_valid, error_msg = validate_ui_input(username, "username", "Username")
  if not is_valid:
      print(f"Invalid input: {error_msg}")
  else:
      sanitized_username = sanitize_ui_input(username)
      print(f"Sanitized username: {sanitized_username}")
  ```
- **Sanitize Data**: Remove or escape potentially malicious content from inputs to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.
- **Validate Form Data**: For complex forms, use `validate_form_data` to ensure all fields meet security criteria.

## Network Security

- **Enforce HTTPS**: All network communications must use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Use `enforce_https_url` from `security.network_security`.
  ```python
  from security.network_security import enforce_https_url, make_secure_request
  
  url = "http://example.com/api"
  secure_url = enforce_https_url(url)  # Converts to https://example.com/api
  response = make_secure_request(secure_url)
  ```
- **Validate SSL Certificates**: Ensure SSL certificates are validated to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Use `validate_ssl_certificate` and `configure_secure_session`.
- **Use NetworkClient**: For all network operations, use the `NetworkClient` class from `core.network_client` which integrates these security measures by default.

## Role-Based Access Control

- **Implement RBAC**: Restrict access to sensitive operations based on user roles using the `RBACManager` from `security.rbac`.
  ```python
  from security.rbac import get_rbac_manager, Permission, Role
  
  rbac = get_rbac_manager()
  # Assign a role to a user
  rbac.assign_user_role("johndoe", Role.USER)
  # Check permission
  if rbac.check_permission("johndoe", Permission.TASK_CREATE):
      print("User can create tasks")
  else:
      print("User cannot create tasks")
  # Enforce permission (raises PermissionError if not allowed)
  rbac.enforce_permission("johndoe", Permission.TASK_CREATE, "Create Task Operation")
  ```
- **Define Roles and Permissions**: Understand the predefined roles (Admin, Manager, User, Guest) and permissions for various operations.
- **Manage Users**: Use the User Management UI to assign or remove roles for users within the application.

## Data Encryption

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use `encrypt_data` and `decrypt_data` from `security.security_utils` for sensitive data at rest.
  ```python
  from security.security_utils import encrypt_data, decrypt_data
  
  sensitive_data = "my-secret-info"
  encrypted = encrypt_data(sensitive_data)
  decrypted = decrypt_data(encrypted)
  print(f"Decrypted data: {decrypted}")  # Outputs: my-secret-info
  ```
- **Key Management**: Store encryption keys securely using environment variables or a key management service. Never commit keys to version control.

## Logging Practices

- **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs**: Never log credentials, API keys, or personal information in plaintext. Use placeholders or redact sensitive data.
  ```python
  from core.logging import get_logger
  
  logger = get_logger("MyModule")
  api_key = "secret-key"
  logger.info("Using API key: [REDACTED]")  # Correct
  logger.info("Using API key: %s", api_key)   # Incorrect - Don't do this
  ```
- **Use Appropriate Log Levels**: Use DEBUG for development details, INFO for general operation status, WARNING for potential issues, and ERROR for failures.

## Dependency Management

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `safety` to check for insecure packages.
  ```bash
  safety check
  ```
- **Pin Dependencies**: Use pinned versions in `requirements.txt` to avoid unexpected updates breaking the application.
- **Review New Dependencies**: Before adding new dependencies, review them for security issues and license compatibility.

## Development Guidelines

- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Code Review**: Conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on security implications for all changes.
- **Avoid `eval()` and `exec()`**: Never use `eval()` or `exec()` with user input as it can lead to code injection.

## Deployment Security

- **Secure Configuration**: Ensure configuration files do not contain sensitive data and are not accessible publicly.
- **Least Privilege**: Run the application with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running as root or with admin rights.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities or performance anomalies.
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular, encrypted backups of critical data and test restoration procedures.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Security**: Integrate security scanning tools (`bandit`, `safety`, `gitleaks`) into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
  ```yaml
  # Example GitHub Actions workflow snippet
  jobs:
    security_scan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: '3.9'
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: pip install safety bandit gitleaks
        - name: Run safety check
          run: safety check
        - name: Run bandit scan
          run: bandit -r .
        - name: Run gitleaks
          run: gitleaks detect
  ```

By adhering to these security best practices, developers and users of Atlas can ensure a robust security posture, protecting both the application and its data from potential threats.

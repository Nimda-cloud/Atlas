# Atlas â€“ Development Plan

This document outlines the development milestones for the Atlas application.

## Phase 1: Application Stabilization (Completed)

- [x] **Fix Application Startup Errors:** Resolve all dependency issues, `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, and initialization order problems to allow the application to launch successfully in development mode.
- [x] **Restore Performance Metrics:** Investigate and fix the `matplotlib` installation issue on macOS to re-enable the performance visualization tab.
- [x] **Full Dependency Audit:** Review and pin all dependencies in `requirements.txt` to ensure reproducible builds.

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Activation

- [ ] **Enable LLM-Powered Agent:** Configure the OpenAI API key in `config.ini` to activate the `LLMManager` and enable the MasterAgent's planning and execution capabilities.
- [ ] **Test Core Agent Loop:** Run a simple goal to verify the agent can generate and execute a plan successfully.
- [ ] **Verify Plugin System:** Test the `Weather Tool` plugin to ensure it can be loaded and its tools can be executed by the agent.

## Phase 3: Feature Enhancement & Refinement

- [ ] **Enhance User Feedback Loop:** Test and refine the user feedback mechanism to ensure it correctly influences future agent plans.
- [ ] **Test Tool Creation Agent:** Verify that the `ToolCreatorAgent` can successfully generate, save, and load a new tool at runtime.
- [ ] **Improve UI/UX:** Conduct a review of the user interface for usability and consistency.

- [x] **Fix MasterAgent Error Recovery:** Stabilize the `MasterAgent` by fixing its error recovery mechanism, resolving test failures, and ensuring robust operation.

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion

- [x] **Implement Dynamic Tool Creation:** Added a `ToolCreatorAgent` that can generate new tools on the fly. This fulfills the need for a new core functionality and significantly expands the agent's capabilities.
- [x] **Enhance GUI:** Improved the user interface for better real-time feedback and user control during agent execution.
  - [x] The Plan View now shows detailed, real-time information for each step, including the tool, arguments, and results.

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

- [x] **Implement long-term memory retrieval for ToolCreatorAgent:** The agent now learns from past tool creation attempts by searching its memory for similar requests and using them as examples in the prompt.
- [x] **Add more complex GUI interactions:** Added a 'Tools' tab to the GUI, allowing users to view dynamically generated tools, their descriptions, and file paths.

- [x] **Fix MasterAgent Prompt Caching**: Resolve the critical bug in `MasterAgent` where prompt caching failed due to duplicated code and incorrect template formatting. This ensures reliable and efficient prompt generation.
- [x] **Enhance Error Recovery in `MasterAgent`**: Implemented a context-aware error recovery system. The agent now analyzes the type of error (e.g., `ToolNotFoundError`, `InvalidToolArgumentsError`) and generates a specialized recovery plan. For a missing tool, it will try to create it; for bad arguments, it will try to fix them.
- [x] **Refactor AgentManager Tool Loading**: Streamlined the dynamic tool loading process in `AgentManager`. It now catches specific errors (e.g., `SyntaxError`) in tool files, logs the issue, and skips the malformed file, preventing a single bad tool from crashing the application.
- [x] **Increase Test Coverage for Core Agents**: Added comprehensive unit tests for `MasterAgent`'s new error recovery logic and `AgentManager`'s resilient tool loading. This ensures the stability and correctness of these critical components.

## Phase 4: GUI Interactivity and Agent Learning

- [ ] **Interactive Tool Management**: Enhance the 'Tools' tab in the GUI.
  - [x] Add a 'Delete' button to allow users to remove a generated tool file.
  - [x] Add an 'Edit' button to open the tool's source file for modification.
- [x] **Enhanced User Feedback Loop**: Improve the learning potential from user feedback.
  - [x] When a user marks a plan as 'Bad', prompt for a brief textual reason for the failure.
  - [x] Store this detailed feedback in memory for future planning.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize key areas of the application.
  - [x] Analyze the performance of tool loading and memory searches as the number of items grows.

## Phase 5: Agent Learning and Advanced Observability

- [ ] **Agent Self-Correction from Feedback**:
  - [x] Implement logic for `MasterAgent` to query `user_feedback` memory before planning.
  - [x] Adjust plan generation based on reasons for past failures on similar goals.

  - [x] Display memory content in a structured, readable format.
- [ ] **Performance Dashboard**:
  - [x] Create a new 'Performance' tab or section in the GUI.
  - [x] Visualize key metrics (tool loading time, memory search latency) using graphs.

## Phase 6: Live Metrics and Enhanced Tooling

- [x] **Live Performance Metrics**:
  - [x] Implement a log parsing utility or a metrics manager to collect performance data.
  - [x] Connect the 'Performance' tab charts to the live data source.
  - [x] Add a mechanism to clear or reset performance data.
- [ ] **Advanced Tool Management**:
  - [x] Add a feature to view the source code of generated tools directly within the GUI.
  - [x] Implement tracking and display of tool usage statistics (e.g., success/failure rates).
- [x] **Interactive Goal Clarification**:
  - [x] Implement a mechanism for the `MasterAgent` to ask for clarification if a goal is ambiguous.
  - [x] Update the GUI to handle and display clarification questions from the agent.

- [x] **Stabilize UI Components**: Ensured all UI elements, including memory tabs and token counters, initialize and update correctly without race conditions.
- [x] **Dependency Injection Fixes**: Corrected `MasterAgent` and `TextAgent` initialization to ensure proper dependency injection (e.g., `LLMManager`).
- [x] **Plugin Loading**: Hardened the `PluginManager` to safely register plugins with varying function signatures.

### Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements

- [ ] **Code Linting and Formatting**: Enforce a consistent code style using `ruff` and `black`.
- [ ] **Add Comprehensive Docstrings**: Ensure all public modules, classes, and functions have clear, Google-style docstrings.
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Analyze and optimize any performance bottlenecks, especially in UI rendering and agent response times.

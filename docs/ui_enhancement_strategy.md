## Objectives

- **Usability**: Simplify navigation, reduce cognitive load, and ensure intuitive interaction with Atlas features.
- **Accessibility**: Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to make Atlas usable by people with disabilities.
- **User Engagement**: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback directly within the app.
- **Personalization**: Allow users to customize the UI appearance and layout to match their preferences.

## Usability Improvements

1. **Navigation Redesign**:
   - Implement a clearer, more hierarchical menu structure.
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for deep workflows.
   - Introduce keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions.
2. **Simplified Workflows**:
   - Reduce the number of clicks needed to complete common tasks.
   - Group related functions together in context-aware panels.
3. **Consistency**:
   - Standardize icons, colors, and typography across all modules.
   - Ensure consistent behavior of UI elements (e.g., buttons, dialogs).

## Accessibility Enhancements

1. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Add ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements.
   - Ensure proper focus management for keyboard navigation.
2. **Color Contrast**:
   - Adjust color schemes to meet minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text).
   - Provide high-contrast mode for users with visual impairments.
3. **Text and Scaling**:
   - Support dynamic text sizing without breaking layouts.
   - Ensure all text is legible at 200% zoom.
4. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Enable full app navigation and operation via keyboard.
   - Provide visible focus indicators for interactive elements.

## User Feedback Mechanisms

1. **In-App Feedback Form**:
   - Add a feedback button accessible from the main UI.
   - Allow users to rate features, report issues, and suggest improvements.
2. **Feedback Analytics**:
   - Anonymously track user interactions to identify pain points.
   - Aggregate feedback data for prioritized development.
3. **Feedback Acknowledgment**:
   - Notify users when their feedback has been received or acted upon.
   - Provide a public roadmap or changelog tied to user suggestions.

## Customizable Themes and Layouts

1. **Themes**:
   - Offer light, dark, and system-default themes.
   - Allow custom theme creation with color pickers for primary UI elements.
2. **Layouts**:
   - Support draggable panels for custom workspace arrangement.
   - Save and load user-defined layout presets.
   - Provide layout templates optimized for different workflows (e.g., developer, designer).
3. **Personalization Persistence**:
   - Store user preferences in their profile, synced via cloud if enabled.
   - Ensure themes and layouts persist across sessions and devices.

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1: Research and Design (2 days)**
  - Conduct user surveys and analyze existing feedback.
  - Create wireframes and mockups for new UI designs.
  - Review accessibility guidelines and best practices.
- **Phase 2: UI Redesign (3 days)**
  - Update PySide6 UI components with new designs.
  - Implement navigation and workflow improvements.
  - Test usability with a small user group.
- **Phase 3: Accessibility Implementation (2 days)**
  - Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
  - Adjust color schemes and test for contrast compliance.
- **Phase 4: Feedback Mechanism (1 day)**
  - Develop in-app feedback form and backend for submissions.
  - Integrate feedback analytics with existing logging systems.
- **Phase 5: Customization Features (2 days)**
  - Implement theme switching and custom theme creation.
  - Add draggable panel support and layout saving.
- **Phase 6: Testing and Iteration (1 day)**
  - Perform usability and accessibility testing.
  - Iterate based on test results and user feedback.

Total Estimated Time: 11 days (slightly over the planned 6-8 days due to comprehensive scope)

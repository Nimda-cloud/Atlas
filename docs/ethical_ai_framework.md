# Ethical AI Framework for Atlas

## Purpose
This document outlines the ethical guidelines and constraints to ensure responsible AI behavior within the Atlas application. The framework aims to prioritize user trust, safety, and fairness in all AI-driven interactions and decisions.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: AI systems must clearly communicate their actions, decisions, and limitations to users. Users should always understand when they are interacting with AI and why certain actions are taken.
   - **Implementation**: Provide clear notifications when AI agents like `TaskPlannerAgent` autonomously create or modify tasks/plans.

2. **User Autonomy**: AI must respect user control and never override user decisions without explicit consent.
   - **Implementation**: Require user confirmation before executing significant AI-generated plans or tasks that impact personal data or schedules.

3. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: AI decisions must avoid bias and ensure equitable treatment across all users, regardless of personal characteristics.
   - **Implementation**: Regularly audit `ContextAnalyzer` and `SelfLearningAgent` for biased patterns in task prioritization or context inference, adjusting algorithms as needed.

4. **Privacy and Data Security**: AI must protect user data, using it only for intended purposes and adhering to strict privacy standards.
   - **Implementation**: Ensure all data processed by AI agents is anonymized where possible, encrypted in storage/transit, and accessible only with user permission.

5. **Accountability**: AI actions must be traceable, with mechanisms to address and rectify any harm caused by AI decisions.
   - **Implementation**: Log all AI decisions (e.g., task creation by `TaskPlannerAgent`) with timestamps and rationale, allowing for review and user feedback.

6. **Safety and Harm Prevention**: AI must prioritize user safety and avoid actions that could cause harm, whether physical, emotional, or financial.
   - **Implementation**: Implement safeguards in `TaskPlannerAgent` to prevent scheduling tasks that conflict with critical user commitments or well-being (e.g., over-scheduling).

## Constraints on AI Behavior

- **Decision Boundaries**: AI agents are prohibited from making decisions involving sensitive personal matters (e.g., health, finances) without explicit user initiation and ongoing consent.
- **Feedback Loop**: AI must provide mechanisms for users to report unethical behavior or incorrect decisions, which will be used to refine AI models.
- **Limitation Awareness**: AI must recognize and communicate its limitations, deferring to human judgment when uncertainty exceeds programmed thresholds.

## Monitoring and Compliance

- **Regular Audits**: Conduct quarterly reviews of AI interactions to ensure adherence to this framework, focusing on user feedback and decision logs.
- **Ethical Oversight**: Establish an internal review board to evaluate AI features before release, ensuring alignment with ethical principles.
- **User Reporting**: Provide an accessible interface within Atlas for users to flag unethical AI behavior, with prompt response protocols.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Integration with Existing Modules**: Embed ethical checks within `TaskPlannerAgent`, `ContextAnalyzer`, and `SelfLearningAgent` to enforce principles like user autonomy and privacy.
2. **User Interface for Ethics**: Develop UI components to notify users of AI actions and request consent where necessary.
3. **Documentation and Training**: Update user guides to explain AI ethics and provide developer training on framework adherence.
4. **Testing for Ethics**: Expand test suites to include scenarios testing ethical behavior (e.g., ensuring AI defers to user on sensitive tasks).

## Continuous Improvement

This framework is a living document, to be updated based on user feedback, technological advancements, and evolving ethical standards. The Atlas team commits to transparency in how AI ethics evolve, keeping users informed of changes.

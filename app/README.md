# App Directory

The `/app` directory is intended as the central location for the main application logic of Atlas. It should house the core entry point and orchestrate the initialization of major components.

## Responsibilities
- **Entry Point**: Contains the main script to launch the Atlas application.
- **Initialization**: Orchestrates the setup of core systems like UI, agents, and plugins.
- **Configuration**: May include application-wide configuration settings.

## Current Status
As of the Phase 10 refactoring, this directory is under review to clarify its role versus root directory responsibilities. It currently contains minimal content and may be expanded or restructured.

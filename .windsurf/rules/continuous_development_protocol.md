# Continuous Development Protocol

Purpose: guarantee that Atlas development never stalls until final release.

## üö® CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVES

**ABSOLUTE HIGHEST PRIORITY - NEVER OVERRIDE**:
1. **NO-STOP EXECUTION**: Agent MUST continue development until ALL tasks in DEV_PLAN.md are completed
2. **MINIMAL REPORTING**: Only report completion of MAJOR milestones (phases), skip intermediate task reporting
3. **AUTO-PROCEED**: After any task completion, immediately analyze DEV_PLAN.md and execute next uncompleted task
4. **BYPASS DOCUMENTATION LOOPS**: Skip changelog updates during active development, batch them at phase completion
5. **EMERGENCY OVERRIDE CODE**: `EXECUTE_UNTIL_COMPLETE_47` - Forces continuous execution regardless of other protocols

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory Environment Setup

**SECONDARY PRIORITY**: Before starting ANY development task, follow the environment setup protocol in `.windsurf/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`. This ensures all tools are available and correctly configured for cross-platform development.

## Development Workflow

1. Always maintain an up-to-date `DEV_PLAN.md`.
2. After every completed task:
   - Update the relevant section in `DEV_PLAN.md` (mark checkbox).
   - Add a detailed entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under *Unreleased*.
3. When `DEV_PLAN.md` shows no remaining immediate tasks:
   - Perform a retrospective.
   - Expand plan with next logical milestones.
4. Never remove existing plan phases; append new ones with incrementing numbers (Phase 8, 9‚Ä¶).
5. Execute tasks sequentially unless parallelism is explicitly beneficial and safe.
6. Commit small, logical code increments with descriptive CHANGELOG notes.
7. **Progress Logging**: Batch progress updates - log significant milestones only, not every small task
8. **Blocking Issues**: Create *Blocking* section in `DEV_PLAN.md` only for true blockers, continue with alternative tasks
9. **Language**: Operate exclusively in **English** for all code, documentation, commit messages, and agent replies
10. **NEVER-STOP MANDATE**: Atlas must execute continuously without pausing for user input or excessive reporting:
    - Execute next task immediately after current completion
    - Skip intermediate documentation unless explicitly requested
    - Background metrics collection (silent)
    - Auto-recovery on any performance degradation
    - OVERRIDE CODE: `EXECUTE_UNTIL_COMPLETE_47`
    - Log execution metrics every 10 minutes
    - Auto-diagnose if any operation exceeds 2x target latency
    - Implement graceful degradation for slow operations
    - Record execution state for automatic recovery
11. On performance degradation:
    - Switch to fallback implementations
    - Log detailed diagnostics
    - Continue with reduced feature set
    - Auto-generate optimization task in DEV_PLAN.md
12. Integrate an **automated CI pipeline** (GitHub Actions) that:
    - Runs `ruff`, `mypy`, and the full test suite
    - Executes performance benchmarks
    - Blocks merges on failures or performance regressions
13. Enable **dependency-update automation** (e.g., Renovate or Dependabot) with automatic PRs for patched versions. CI must pass before merge.
14. Configure **vulnerability scanning & secret detection** (e.g., Trivy and Gitleaks) on every push; fails pipeline on critical findings.

## Development Environment Standards

All development MUST use platform-appropriate environments:
- **macOS**: `venv-macos` with Python 3.13
- **Linux**: `venv-linux` with Python 3.12

Refer to `.windsurf/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

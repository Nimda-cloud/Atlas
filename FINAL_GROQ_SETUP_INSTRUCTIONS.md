# 🚀 Atlas Groq Setup - Final Instructions

## ✅ Status: Configuration Fixed Successfully!

The configuration conflict has been resolved. Atlas is now properly configured to use Groq as the default provider.

## 📋 Current Configuration Status

Your Atlas configuration is now set to:
- **Provider**: `groq`
- **Model**: `llama3-8b-8192`
- **Config File**: `~/.atlas/config.yaml`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Configuration Priority**: Fixed the conflict between multiple config files
2. **UI Integration**: Enhanced settings UI now properly saves and loads provider settings
3. **Default Provider**: Atlas now loads Groq as the default provider instead of Gemini

## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### 1. Add Your Groq API Key

Edit the configuration file:
```bash
nano ~/.atlas/config.yaml
```

Find the `api_keys` section and add your Groq API key:
```yaml
api_keys:
  groq: 'your-actual-groq-api-key-here'  # Replace with your real API key
  # ... other keys
```

### 2. Restart Atlas

After adding your API key, restart Atlas:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Verify Groq is Working

1. **Check Settings Tab**: Go to "Settings" tab and verify "groq" is selected as the current provider
2. **Test Chat**: Try sending a message in the Chat tab - it should use Groq
3. **Check Logs**: Look for "Current provider: groq" in the startup logs

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check current configuration
cat ~/.atlas/config.yaml

# Test settings loading
python test_groq_settings.py

# Start Atlas and check logs
python main.py
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Atlas Still Uses Gemini:

1. **Check Config File**: Ensure `current_provider: groq` is in `~/.atlas/config.yaml`
2. **Clear Cache**: Delete any `.env` files that might override settings
3. **Restart**: Make sure to restart Atlas completely

### If Groq API Key Issues:

1. **Verify Key**: Make sure your Groq API key is valid
2. **Check Format**: Ensure the key is properly formatted in the config file
3. **Test Connection**: Use the "Test Current Provider" button in Settings

### If Settings Don't Persist:

1. **Use Enhanced Settings**: Go to "Settings" tab and use the LLM Settings section
2. **Save Settings**: Click "Save Settings" after making changes
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure Atlas can write to `~/.atlas/config.yaml`

## 📊 Expected Behavior

After setup, you should see:
- Startup log: `"Current provider: groq, model: llama3-8b-8192"`
- Settings tab shows Groq as selected provider
- Chat responses come from Groq models
- No more Gemini fallback messages

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ Atlas starts with "Current provider: groq" in logs  
✅ Settings tab shows Groq as current provider  
✅ Chat works without "Gemini API key not found" messages  
✅ Fast responses from Groq's optimized models  

## 🔄 Switching Back to Other Providers

If you want to switch back to other providers:

1. **Via UI**: Use the Settings tab to select a different provider
2. **Via Config**: Edit `~/.atlas/config.yaml` and change `current_provider`
3. **Save**: Always save settings after changing

**Note:** If you want to return to Gemini, simply change `current_provider: gemini` in `~/.atlas/config.yaml` or use the UI to change the provider.

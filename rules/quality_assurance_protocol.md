# Quality Assurance Protocol

## Purpose
To maintain the highest standards of code quality, security, and user experience in 'Atlas', ensuring the application is robust, maintainable, and aligned with project requirements.

## Core Directives
**DIRECTIVE QA-001**: ZERO-TOLERANCE CODE QUALITY  
All code MUST pass linting (`ruff`), type checking (`mypy`), and have comprehensive tests before integration. No exceptions.

**DIRECTIVE QA-002**: SECURITY-FIRST ARCHITECTURE  
Every new tool and agent MUST undergo security review. Screen capture, input simulation, and file system access require explicit permission checks.

**DIRECTIVE QA-003**: MACOS NATIVE COMPATIBILITY  
All tools MUST work seamlessly on macOS Sequoia using native APIs (Quartz, AppKit, Vision) where possible. Fallbacks are documented.

**DIRECTIVE QA-004**: PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS  
Screen operations MUST complete under 100ms. AI inference MUST complete under 5 seconds. Memory usage MUST stay under 500MB baseline.

## Guidelines
1. **Linting & Static Analysis**: Run `ruff` and `mypy` before every commit to enforce code style and type safety. Fix all warnings and errors.
2. **Testing Coverage**: Require comprehensive PyTest cases for new modules, covering core logic and edge cases. Aim for at least 80% coverage.
3. **Documentation Standards**: Ensure all public functions, classes, and modules have detailed docstrings in Google style, explaining purpose, parameters, and return values.
4. **Security Review**: Before merging or deploying changes, verify all actions against security rules defined in the 'Security Settings' tab. Address any potential vulnerabilities.
5. **GUI UX Consistency**: Manually test new GUI widgets on macOS Sequoia for visual consistency, responsiveness, and accessibility. Ensure alignment with CustomTkinter theme.
6. **Performance Metrics**: For tools interacting with screen or input (e.g., screenshot, mouse emulation), measure latency and keep it under 100 ms. Optimize if necessary.
7. **Dependency Management**: Audit `requirements.txt` to keep dependencies minimal and pinned to specific versions to avoid compatibility issues.
8. **Review Cycle**: Perform a self-review of code diffs before finalizing changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed entries, and ensure all quality gates are passed.
9. **Release Readiness**: Before any release or milestone, ensure all tests pass, documentation is complete, and security checks are clear. Verify GUI and tool functionality on a clean macOS environment.
10. **Error Handling**: All tools MUST implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages and graceful degradation.
11. **API Consistency**: All tools MUST return standardized response objects with success/failure status, data payload, and error details.
12. **Resource Management**: Properly manage system resources (memory, file handles, network connections) with context managers and cleanup procedures.

## Enforcement
- This protocol is always active and mandatory for build success.
- Non-compliance with quality standards will block commits or merges until resolved.
- Automated checks via CI will enforce linting, testing, and coverage requirements, with failures requiring immediate fixes.

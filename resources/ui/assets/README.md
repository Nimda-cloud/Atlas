# UI Assets Directory for Atlas

This directory is intended to store UI assets for the Atlas application, such as icons, logos, and placeholder images, as referenced in the UI Design Specifications (ASC-024).

## Structure
- **icons/**: For Material Design Icons or custom icons used in the application.
- **logos/**: For Atlas logo variants (e.g., white for header).
- **placeholders/**: For placeholder images used in UI elements like task cards or profiles.

## Usage
Assets in this directory should be integrated into the PySide6 application via a Qt Resource File (.qrc) for efficient loading and bundling with the application.

**Note**: This directory structure will be populated with actual assets during the implementation phase. Currently, it serves as a placeholder for organizational purposes.

If you have specific assets or icon sets to include immediately, please let me know.

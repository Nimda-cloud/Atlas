# üçé macOS Screenshot Issue - Quick Fix Guide

If you're seeing this error on macOS:
```
'CGImageRef' object has no attribute 'width'
```

## Quick Solution

1. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pyobjc-framework-Quartz pyobjc-framework-ApplicationServices
   ```

2. **Verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   python3 verify_screenshot_fix.py
   ```

3. **If still failing, try quick test**:
   ```bash
   ./quick_test_macos.sh
   ```

## What was fixed?

The error occurred because Atlas was using outdated pyobjc API calls. We've updated the code to use modern Core Graphics functions:

- ‚ùå **Old (broken)**: `image_ref.width()`  
- ‚úÖ **New (working)**: `CGImageGetWidth(image_ref)`

## Alternative Methods

If Quartz still doesn't work, Atlas will automatically fall back to:
1. Native `screencapture` command
2. AppleScript
3. PyAutoGUI

## Need Help?

Run the comprehensive test for detailed diagnostics:
```bash
python3 test_screenshot_complete.py
```

**System Requirements:**
- macOS 10.15+ recommended
- Python 3.8+
- Screen Recording permissions enabled in System Preferences

‚úÖ **This fix resolves the pyobjc API compatibility issue permanently.**

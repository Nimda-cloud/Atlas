### WFE-016 Multimodal Control Interface

- **Fixed Import Errors**: Added missing functions `constant_time_compare`, `secure_hash`, and `check_environment_security` to `security_utils.py` and updated imports in `security/__init__.py` to resolve import errors when running the multimodal control demo.
- **Updated Voice Command Parser**: Enhanced `voice_command_parser.py` to handle missing `pyaudio` gracefully during initialization.
- **Updated Tests**: Modified `test_voice_command_parser.py` to correctly mock `pyaudio` availability and pass tests even when dependencies are missing.
- **Added Error Handling to Demo**: Added comprehensive error handling to `multimodal_control_demo.py` to catch import errors and provide detailed feedback for debugging.
- **Added Fallback for Security Checks**: Implemented a fallback for `check_environment_security` in `atlas_application.py` to ensure the demo can run without import errors.
- **Fixed Hotkey Mapping**: Updated hotkey names in `multimodal_control_demo.py` and `gesture_hotkey_mapper.py` to use valid key names recognized by the keyboard library, resolving ValueError for unrecognized characters.
- **Added Hotkey Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in `gesture_hotkey_mapper.py` to catch permission issues and unrecognized key errors, ensuring the demo runs without crashing due to keyboard library limitations on macOS.
- **Added Fallback for Config Loading**: Updated `config.py`, `feature_flags.py`, and `ai_integration.py` with fallback mechanisms for `load_config` to resolve import errors during demo execution.
- **Added PluginMetadata Class**: Added the missing `PluginMetadata` class to `plugin_system.py` to resolve import errors in the demo.
- **Added Hotkey Fallbacks for macOS**: Updated `multimodal_control_demo.py` to include alternative hotkey combinations using 'command' for macOS compatibility.
- **Added Fallback for PluginMetadata**: Implemented a fallback for `PluginMetadata` and other critical imports in `core/__init__.py` to ensure the demo runs without import errors.
- **Updated Hotkey Mapper for macOS**: Enhanced `gesture_hotkey_mapper.py` to automatically map 'ctrl' to 'command' for macOS compatibility.
- **Simplified Hotkey Registration**: Updated `multimodal_control_demo.py` to use only macOS-friendly hotkey combinations with 'command' for better compatibility.
- **Created module_base.py**: Added `module_base.py` to the core directory to provide the missing `ModuleBase` class, resolving the import error in the demo.
- **Updated Hotkey Error Messages**: Enhanced error messages in `gesture_hotkey_mapper.py` to provide guidance for macOS users on running the script with sudo or adjusting permissions for keyboard access.

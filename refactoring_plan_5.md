## 5. Refactoring Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Priority | Dependencies |
|------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Preparation | 1-2 weeks | High | - |
| Architectural refactoring | 3-4 weeks | High | Preparation |
| Core refactoring | 2-3 weeks | High | Arch. refactoring |
| Module refactoring | 4-6 weeks | Medium | Core refactoring |
| UI refactoring | 3-4 weeks | Medium | Module refactoring |
| Testing & documentation | 2-3 weeks | Medium | All previous stages |
| Deployment and integration | 1-2 weeks | Low | All previous stages |

## 6. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Strategy |
|-------|------------|-------|----------|
| Breaking compatibility with existing plugins | High | High | Creating adapters for the old API |
| Feature regressions | Medium | High | Thorough testing, phased implementation |
| Schedule delays | Medium | Medium | Flexible planning, task prioritization |
| Performance issues | Low | High | Early profiling, testing with real data |
| Complexity for new developers | Medium | Low | Detailed documentation, code examples |

## 7. Resource Estimation

- **Human Resources**:
  - 1-2 backend developers (Python, PySide6)
  - 1 UI/UX designer
  - 1 QA engineer

- **Time Resources**:
  - Total duration: 14-21 weeks (3.5-5 months)
  - Depending on resource availability and scope of work

- **Technical Resources**:
  - Development environment
  - Testing environment
  - CI/CD environment

## 8. Refactoring Success Criteria

- Preservation of all existing functionality
- Application performance improvement of 20%+
- Reduction in errors by 30%+
- Improved code readability and structure
- Extended plugin system with documentation
- Test coverage of at least 80%
- Complete documentation for developers and users

## 9. Conclusion

This refactoring plan represents a comprehensive approach to improving Atlas while maintaining its unique cyberpunk style and extensibility. Through a structured approach, each refactoring stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring stability and gradual system improvement.

The main advantages after refactoring will be:
- Better scalability and maintainability of code
- Improved architecture with clear boundaries of responsibility
- Enhanced plugin system with better API
- Improved UX/UI in cyberpunk style
- Higher performance and stability

This refactoring will lay the foundation for future development of Atlas and the addition of new features without compromising code quality or performance.

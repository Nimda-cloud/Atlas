# Post-Launch Optimization Plan (ASC-030)

## Objective
To address immediate post-launch issues, enhance performance, and improve user onboarding for Atlas, ensuring a stable and user-friendly experience.

## Bug Fixes and Crash Resolutions
- **Identification and Prioritization**: Utilize crash reports from App Store and GitHub issues to identify bugs. Prioritize based on severity (critical crashes first) and frequency of occurrence.
- **Implementation**: Allocate developer sprints to address critical bugs within 48 hours. Use hotfix releases for urgent issues.
- **Testing**: Conduct regression testing on all supported platforms (primarily macOS, with checks for potential Windows compatibility) to ensure fixes do not introduce new issues.
- **Tools**: Use Sentry for real-time crash reporting, GitHub Issues for tracking, and TestFlight for beta testing fixes.

## Performance Improvements
- **Audit**: Perform a comprehensive performance audit using profiling tools to pinpoint bottlenecks in app responsiveness and load times.
- **Optimization**: Focus on optimizing database queries by indexing frequently accessed data, reducing API call overhead with batch processing, and implementing lazy loading for UI elements.
- **Caching**: Introduce Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed user data like task lists and preferences to reduce server load.
- **Metrics**: Target a response time of under 100ms for UI interactions and under 500ms for data operations.
- **Timeline**: Complete initial audit within 3 days, implement optimizations over 7 days, with 4 days for testing and iteration.

## Onboarding Experience
- **Simplification**: Analyze user feedback to remove unnecessary steps in the setup process. Aim to reduce onboarding time by 30%.
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Develop a step-by-step interactive guide within the app, highlighting key features like task creation, AI suggestions, and customization options. Use animations for engagement.
- **Analytics**: Implement Mixpanel or similar to track where users drop off during onboarding. Use this data to refine the flow.
- **Timeline**: Design and develop new onboarding flow over 7 days, test with a small user group for 3 days, iterate based on feedback for another 4 days.

## Success Metrics
- **Bug Resolution**: Achieve a 90% resolution rate for critical bugs within the first week post-identification.
- **Performance**: Reduce average app load time by 20% and UI interaction latency to under 100ms.
- **Onboarding**: Increase completion rate of onboarding process by 25% and reduce average setup time.

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 14 days
- **Breakdown**:
  - Bug Fixes: Ongoing, with critical fixes within 48 hours
  - Performance Audit and Optimization: Days 1-10
  - Onboarding Redesign and Testing: Days 4-14

## Dependencies
- Relies on user feedback and crash data collected from ASC-027 (Public Launch Execution).
- Builds on initial feature performance data from ASC-029 (Feature Expansion).

## Communication
- Weekly updates to the community via Discord and GitHub Discussions on bug fix progress and performance improvements.
- Notify users of significant updates through in-app messages and email newsletters.

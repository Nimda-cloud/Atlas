# Feedback Analysis Plan for Atlas (ASC-029)

This document outlines the approach for analyzing user feedback to prioritize feature development and bug fixes as part of ASC-029. Feedback analysis is critical to ensure Atlas evolves in line with user needs.

## Objectives
- **Collect Data**: Aggregate feedback from multiple channels post-launch.
- **Identify Trends**: Pinpoint common issues or feature requests for prioritization.
- **Action Plan**: Define next steps for development based on analysis.

## Feedback Sources
1. **In-App Feedback**: Review submissions from the integrated feedback form.
2. **GitHub Issues**: Analyze bug reports and feature requests with user votes.
3. **App Store Reviews**: Extract themes from macOS App Store user comments.
4. **Community Channels**: Monitor Discord, Reddit, and GitHub Discussions for recurring topics.
5. **Survey Results**: Include structured feedback from beta tester surveys.

## Analysis Methodology
1. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Centralize feedback into a single database or spreadsheet for review.
   - Categorize entries by type (bug, feature request, usability issue).
2. **Quantitative Metrics**:
   - Count frequency of similar reports to gauge prevalence (e.g., 50 users report slow startup).
   - Track user ratings (e.g., average 3.5/5 from App Store) for overall satisfaction.
3. **Qualitative Insights**:
   - Identify recurring themes or pain points in detailed comments.
   - Highlight unique suggestions that could differentiate Atlas.
4. **Prioritization Framework**:
   - Rank issues by Severity (impact on user experience) and Frequency (number of reports).
   - High Priority: Critical bugs affecting core functionality (e.g., crashes on launch).
   - Medium Priority: Popular feature requests or major usability issues.
   - Low Priority: Minor bugs or niche suggestions.

## Initial Findings (Hypothetical)
Based on simulated feedback for planning purposes:
- **Critical Bugs**: 30% of users report crashes when syncing large datasets.
- **Usability Issues**: 40% find task search slow or inaccurate.
- **Feature Requests**: 50+ requests for real-time collaboration tools.
- **AI Suggestions**: Users want more context-aware AI prompts (25 mentions).

## Actionable Priorities
1. **Bug Fixes**: Address sync crashes immediately with a hotfix (High Priority).
2. **Search Optimization**: Improve search speed and accuracy in next update (Medium Priority).
3. **Collaboration Features**: Plan real-time task sharing for medium-term roadmap (Medium Priority).
4. **AI Enhancements**: Enhance AI personalization based on user context (Medium Priority).

## Timeline
- **Day 1-3**: Aggregate feedback from all sources and categorize.
- **Day 4-5**: Analyze data for trends, prioritize issues, and draft action plan.
- **Day 6-7**: Share findings with community for validation and begin implementation planning.

Total Estimated Time: 7 days

# Advanced Collaboration Features Plan (ASC-032)

## Objective
To enhance Atlas with advanced collaboration capabilities, enabling seamless teamwork through real-time sharing, integrations with communication tools, and robust team management features.

## Real-Time Sharing and Editing
- **Backend Development**: Implement a WebSocket-based system for real-time data synchronization. Use libraries like `socket.io` for Python to handle bi-directional communication between client and server.
- **UI Implementation**: Design interface elements to show when other users are editing tasks. Include visual indicators for live updates and a conflict resolution modal if simultaneous edits occur.
- **Testing**: Conduct stress tests to ensure system stability under high concurrent user loads. Target latency of under 200ms for updates to appear across clients.
- **Security**: Ensure data transmitted over WebSocket is encrypted with TLS. Implement user authentication to restrict access to authorized team members only.
- **Timeline**: Backend setup over 7 days, UI development over 5 days, testing and iteration for 4 days.

## Integration with Communication Tools (Slack Focus)
- **API Integration**: Develop a Slack app using Slack's Bolt framework for Python to receive and send messages. Enable Atlas to post task updates and notifications to specified Slack channels.
- **Task Creation**: Allow users to create tasks directly from Slack by typing commands like `/atlas-task "Complete report by Friday"`. Parse these commands to create tasks in Atlas with relevant metadata.
- **Security**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization between Atlas and Slack. Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in Slack messages; use secure tokens for API calls.
- **User Experience**: Provide a setup guide within Atlas for connecting Slack workspaces. Include toggles for notification preferences to avoid spam.
- **Timeline**: API integration and command setup over 6 days, security and testing for 3 days, documentation and UX polish for 3 days.

## Team Management Features
- **Roles and Permissions**: Define user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with specific permissions for task creation, editing, deletion, and project management. Store these in the database with a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **Dashboard**: Create a team dashboard showing active projects, task completion rates, and individual contributions. Use Chart.js or a similar library for visual data representation.
- **Notifications**: Implement a notification system for task assignments, deadlines, and updates. Allow customization of notification frequency and delivery (in-app, email).
- **Testing**: Validate that permissions restrict actions appropriately across roles. Ensure dashboard data updates in real-time with WebSocket integration.
- **Timeline**: Role system and permissions over 5 days, dashboard development for 5 days, notifications setup and testing for 3 days.

## Success Metrics
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Achieve under 200ms latency for task update propagation in 90% of test cases.
- **Slack Integration**: Enable 80% of test users to set up Slack integration without assistance, with task creation success rate above 95%.
- **Team Features**: Ensure 100% accuracy in permission enforcement during testing, with dashboard loading times under 2 seconds.

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 28 days
- **Breakdown**:
  - Real-Time Sharing Backend and UI: Days 1-12
  - Real-Time Sharing Testing and Security: Days 13-16
  - Slack Integration Development: Days 5-11
  - Slack Security and UX: Days 12-14
  - Team Management Roles and Dashboard: Days 15-24
  - Team Notifications and Final Testing: Days 25-28

## Dependencies
- Builds on community feedback for collaboration needs from ASC-028 (Community Engagement and Support).
- Requires stable real-time sync infrastructure before full team feature rollout.

## Technical Requirements
- **WebSocket**: Use `websocket-client` or `socket.io` for Python.
- **Slack API**: Slack Bolt SDK for integration.
- **Frontend**: Enhance Qt-based UI with real-time indicators using PySide6.
- **Database**: Extend existing schema to support team roles and permissions.

## Communication
- Update users on collaboration feature progress via Discord and GitHub Discussions.
- Solicit beta testers from the community for real-time editing and Slack integration testing phases.
- Announce feature launch with tutorials and in-app guides to drive adoption.

# AI Enhancements Plan for Atlas (ASC-029)

This document outlines the strategy for enhancing AI capabilities in Atlas to provide more personalized suggestions as part of ASC-029. Improved AI will increase user productivity and satisfaction.

## Objectives
- **Personalization**: Tailor AI suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Context Awareness**: Enhance AI's ability to understand task context for relevant outputs.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user input to refine AI models continuously.

## Enhancement Strategies
1. **User Behavior Analysis**:
   - Track user interactions (e.g., frequently used task categories, completion patterns) anonymously.
   - Use this data to suggest relevant subtasks or prioritize certain actions.
2. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - Improve natural language processing to interpret task descriptions better.
   - Integrate contextual cues (e.g., deadlines, related tasks) into suggestion algorithms.
3. **Learning from Feedback**:
   - Allow users to rate AI suggestions (thumbs up/down) for reinforcement learning.
   - Adjust suggestion weights based on user acceptance or rejection patterns.
4. **Custom Prompt Library**:
   - Enable users to save custom prompts for recurring needs (e.g., 'Draft a meeting agenda').
   - Suggest saved prompts when similar tasks are created.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Implement opt-in telemetry for user interaction data with clear privacy notices.
   - Ensure data is anonymized and complies with GDPR or similar regulations.
2. **Algorithm Updates**:
   - Enhance existing AI models with user-specific weighting for personalization.
   - Test context-aware prompts using a subset of tasks for accuracy.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Add a simple rating UI for AI suggestions within the task editor.
   - Log feedback to a central system for periodic model retraining.
4. **Custom Prompts**:
   - Develop a UI for saving and managing custom prompts in settings.
   - Integrate prompt suggestions into task creation workflows.

## Timeline
- **Day 1-3**: Design telemetry and feedback UI, ensure privacy compliance.
- **Day 4-6**: Update AI algorithms for personalization and context awareness.
- **Day 7-8**: Implement custom prompt library and test integrations.
- **Day 9-10**: Beta test enhancements with community, gather initial feedback.

Total Estimated Time: 10 days

## Success Metrics
- Increase in user acceptance rate of AI suggestions by 20% post-update.
- Positive feedback on personalization from at least 30% of active users.
- Usage of custom prompts by 15% of users within the first month.

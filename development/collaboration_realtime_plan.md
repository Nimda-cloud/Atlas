# Real-Time Collaboration Plan for Atlas (ASC-032)

## Objective
To implement real-time sharing and editing capabilities in Atlas, enabling seamless collaboration for teams by allowing instant task updates across multiple users and devices.

## Technology Choice: WebSocket
- **Rationale**: WebSocket provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, ideal for real-time updates with low latency compared to polling or HTTP-based solutions.
- **Library**: Use `websocket-client` and `websockets` for Python backend, compatible with asyncio for asynchronous handling in Atlas's architecture.

## Architecture Overview
1. **Backend (Server)**:
   - Implement a WebSocket server to handle connections from multiple clients.
   - Use Redis Pub/Sub as a message broker to scale WebSocket connections.
2. **Frontend (Client)**:
   - Connect to the WebSocket server from the Atlas app.
   - Update UI in real-time based on incoming messages.
3. **Database Integration**:
   - Sync updates to the SQLite database for persistence.
   - Handle conflicts using last-write-wins initially.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Setup (Days 1-7)
- Install necessary dependencies (`websockets`, Redis).
- Develop WebSocket server endpoint in Atlas backend.
- Implement Redis Pub/Sub for team updates.

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Days 8-14)
- Add WebSocket client logic in PySide6 app.
- Handle incoming messages to update UI.
- Implement reconnection logic for dropped connections.

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution & Testing (Days 15-21)
- Develop basic conflict resolution.
- Test real-time updates with multiple users.
- Stress test with simulated users.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Optimization (Days 22-28)
- Deploy WebSocket server with secure connections (WSS).
- Optimize Redis Pub/Sub channels.
- Monitor server load in initial rollout.

## Success Criteria
- Achieve real-time task updates with latency under 100ms.
- Support at least 50 concurrent connections per team.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Scalability**: Use Redis Pub/Sub to offload broadcasting.
- **Latency**: Optimize message size, provide local-first updates.

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 28 days.
- **Milestone Check**: Backend by Day 7, frontend by Day 14.

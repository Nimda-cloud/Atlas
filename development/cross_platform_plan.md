# Cross-Platform Compatibility Plan for Atlas (ASC-029)

This document outlines the strategy for assessing and improving cross-platform compatibility for Atlas as part of ASC-029. Expanding platform support will broaden user access if demand is evident.

## Objectives
- **Assess Demand**: Evaluate user feedback for requests on Windows, Linux, or mobile support.
- **Feasibility Study**: Analyze technical requirements and resource needs for new platforms.
- **Implementation Plan**: Outline steps for initial cross-platform support if justified.

## Demand Assessment
1. **Feedback Review**:
   - Check GitHub Issues, community channels, and surveys for platform requests.
   - Quantify demand (e.g., number of users requesting Windows support).
2. **Market Analysis**:
   - Research competitor tools for typical platform coverage.
   - Estimate potential user base growth with additional platforms.
3. **Threshold for Action**:
   - Proceed with development if 20% or more of feedback mentions a specific platform need.

## Feasibility Study
1. **Technical Requirements**:
   - **Windows**: Assess PySide6 compatibility and packaging needs for Windows 10/11.
   - **Linux**: Evaluate distribution challenges (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) and dependency management.
   - **Mobile**: Review frameworks like Kivy or Flutter for iOS/Android feasibility.
2. **Resource Estimation**:
   - Calculate development time (e.g., 2 months per platform for initial port).
   - Estimate testing and maintenance overhead for each platform.
3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Ensure core features (AI, UI) perform comparably across platforms.
   - Identify platform-specific optimizations if needed (e.g., Metal on macOS vs. DirectX on Windows).

## Hypothetical Demand Results
- **Windows**: 25% of feedback requests support (above threshold).
- **Linux**: 10% of feedback mentions (below threshold).
- **Mobile**: 15% interest in iOS/Android (below threshold).

## Implementation Plan (Windows Focus)
Assuming Windows meets demand threshold:
1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Configure Windows VMs for testing with Visual Studio for build tools.
   - Use existing macOS codebase, adapt for Windows-specific issues.
2. **Code Porting**:
   - Adjust UI rendering for Windows scaling and themes.
   - Replace macOS-specific APIs (e.g., PyObjC) with cross-platform alternatives.
3. **Packaging and Distribution**:
   - Use PyInstaller for Windows executables.
   - Host Windows builds on GitHub Releases alongside macOS versions.
4. **Testing**:
   - Run full test suite on Windows, focusing on AI inference and UI.
   - Recruit Windows beta testers from community for real-world feedback.

## Timeline (Windows)
- **Day 1-2**: Confirm demand and finalize feasibility study.
- **Day 3-7**: Set up Windows dev environment, begin porting key modules.
- **Day 8-10**: Complete initial build, test, and prepare for beta release.

Total Estimated Time: 10 days (for initial Windows assessment and planning)

## Decision Point
- If demand for other platforms increases post-Windows release, revisit plan.
- If demand threshold not met for any platform, document findings and delay cross-platform work.

## Overview

The wireframes aim to simplify navigation, reduce cognitive load, and ensure intuitive interaction. These designs are conceptual and will be refined based on user feedback and testing. Note: These are textual descriptions of visual wireframes, as actual graphical mockups would be created in a design tool like Figma or Sketch during actual implementation.

## Main Navigation Redesign

**Wireframe 1: Hierarchical Menu Structure**
- **Header Bar**: Fixed at the top with the Atlas logo on the left, followed by primary navigation tabs (e.g., Home, Tasks, Chat, Plugins, Settings).
- **Sidebar (Collapsible)**: On the left, showing sub-navigation for the selected primary tab. For example, under 'Tasks', sub-items like 'My Tasks', 'Team Tasks', 'Completed'.
- **Breadcrumb Trail**: Below the header bar, showing the current path (e.g., Home > Tasks > My Tasks).
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Overlay**: Accessible via a '?' key, displaying a popup with shortcuts for quick navigation.

**Purpose**: Reduces navigation complexity by grouping related functions and providing clear context through breadcrumbs.

**Wireframe 2: Central Workspace**
- **Main Content Area**: Takes up 70-80% of the screen, dynamically adjusting based on the selected tab or task.
- **Contextual Toolbar**: Appears at the top of the content area, offering quick actions relevant to the current view (e.g., 'New Task' button in Tasks view).
- **Quick Search Bar**: Always visible in the header, allowing search across all Atlas modules.

**Purpose**: Centralizes focus on the current task while maintaining access to key functions.

## Simplified Workflows

**Wireframe 3: Task Creation Flow**
- **Single-Click Initiation**: 'New Task' button in toolbar opens a compact modal dialog.
- **Minimal Fields**: Only essential fields visible by default (Title, Priority, Due Date), with an 'Advanced' toggle for additional options (Assignee, Tags, Description).
- **Inline Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for priority or due date based on task title input.
- **Save & New Option**: Button to save the current task and immediately create another without closing the modal.

**Purpose**: Reduces clicks and time spent on repetitive actions like task creation.

**Wireframe 4: Context-Aware Panels**
- **Dynamic Side Panel**: Appears on the right when selecting an item (e.g., a task), showing related actions and details (e.g., Edit, Assign, Comment).
- **Collapsible Sub-Panels**: Within the side panel, group related functions (e.g., 'Comments' can be expanded/collapsed).
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Move tasks between lists or panels directly if applicable.

**Purpose**: Groups related functions together, reducing navigation to separate screens.

## Consistent UI Elements

**Wireframe 5: Standardized UI Kit**
- **Icon Set**: Unified icon library (e.g., Material Design Icons) with consistent size (24px) and style across all modules.
- **Color Palette**: Defined primary, secondary, and accent colors used consistently (e.g., primary blue for buttons, green for success states).
- **Typography**: Standardized font family (e.g., Roboto) and sizes (e.g., 16px for body text, 20px for headings).
- **Button Styles**: Consistent button shapes (rounded corners), sizes, and states (hover, disabled, active).

**Purpose**: Creates a cohesive visual language, reducing user confusion.

## Accessibility Features

**Wireframe 6: Accessibility Mode Toggle**
- **High-Contrast Mode Button**: In Settings or quick access toolbar, toggles a high-contrast theme.
- **Text Size Slider**: In Settings > Accessibility, allows increasing/decreasing text size globally.
- **Focus Indicator**: Visible border around focused elements for keyboard navigation.
- **ARIA Label Indicators**: In design mockups, annotations showing where ARIA labels are added for screen readers (e.g., on icons without text).

**Purpose**: Ensures the UI is usable by individuals with visual or motor impairments.

These wireframes form the foundation for the UI redesign. The next steps include creating high-fidelity mockups in a design tool, gathering user feedback on these concepts, and iterating before implementation. If you have any immediate feedback or adjustments to these wireframes, please let me know before proceeding to the design phase.

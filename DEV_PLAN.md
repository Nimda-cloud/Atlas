# Atlas Development Plan: The Path to True Autonomy

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for evolving Atlas from a task-based assistant into a proactive, learning-capable autonomous partner, capable of complex reasoning and seamless human-computer symbiosis.

## Phase 1: Core Cognitive Architecture - "The Thinker"

**Objective:** To build a robust cognitive framework that enables Atlas to reason, plan, and self-correct with a high degree of autonomy.

- [x] **Implement Three-Tier Hierarchical Planning:**
    - [x] **Strategic Layer:** Decomposes high-level, abstract goals into major strategic objectives.
    - [x] **Tactical Layer:** Breaks down strategic objectives into concrete, multi-step plans.
    - [x] **Operational Layer:** Translates tactical steps into specific, executable tool commands.
- [ ] **Test and Validate Planning System:**
    - [x] **Stabilize Test Environment:** Resolved critical import errors and test collection hangs, enabling reliable `pytest` execution.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `StrategicPlanner` and `TacticalPlanner`.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the full `MasterAgent` planning and execution loop.
- [ ] **Develop Advanced Reasoning & Self-Correction Loop:**
    - Implement a meta-cognitive process for Atlas to analyze its own performance.
    - When a plan fails, Atlas will identify the root cause (e.g., flawed assumption, incorrect tool, environmental change) and autonomously generate a revised plan.
- [ ] **Enhance Foundational Thinking Models:**
    - Integrate more sophisticated reasoning models (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought) into the planning and execution process.

## Phase 2: Long-Term Memory & Continuous Learning - "The Learner"

**Objective:** To create a memory system that allows Atlas to learn, adapt, and grow from every interaction.

- [ ] **Refine Long-Term Vector Memory Formation:**
    - Implement a more sophisticated memory ingestion pipeline that automatically distills raw interaction data into structured, vectorized knowledge.
    - Develop a mechanism for memory consolidation and summarization to maintain a coherent and efficient knowledge base over time.
- [ ] **Implement Active & Passive Learning Mechanisms:**
    - **Active Learning:** Atlas will proactively ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity and fill knowledge gaps.
    - **Passive Learning:** Atlas will observe user actions and workflows to infer preferences, habits, and project-specific knowledge without direct instruction.

## Phase 3: Human-AI Symbiosis - "The Partner"

**Objective:** To create a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user interface that fosters true collaboration.

- [ ] **Design a Next-Generation "Cognitive Dashboard" UI:**
    - Move beyond a simple chat interface to a dynamic dashboard that visualizes:
        - Atlas's current goal and high-level plan.
        - The specific step being executed.
        - Key contextual information being considered.
        - A "confidence score" for its current action.
- [ ] **Ensure Flawless Functionality and Information Density:**
    - Every UI element must be functional, responsive, and provide clear, actionable information.
    - Implement a robust status and notification system.
- [ ] **Build Advanced User Controls:**
    - Create a settings panel for users to inspect Atlas's learned knowledge, correct false beliefs, and fine-tune its autonomy level (from "manual approval" to "fully autonomous").

## Phase 4: Omniscient Integration - "The Ghost in the Machine"

**Objective:** To give Atlas the ability to perceive and interact with the user's entire digital environment, just as a human would.

- [ ] **Develop Comprehensive Observability Tools:**
    - Grant Atlas the ability to see the screen, understand UI elements, and monitor active processes and files.
- [ ] **Grant Full System Interaction Capabilities:**
    - Enable Atlas to control the mouse, keyboard, and system-level commands, allowing it to operate any application.
- [ ] **Implement Tool Synthesis and Discovery:**
    - Give Atlas the ability to find new software libraries and APIs, read their documentation, and dynamically generate new tools for itself to solve novel problems.

- **Scope Management**: Balancing multiple subtasks within tight timelines.
  - **Lesson**: Break tasks into smaller, manageable units for smoother execution.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Real User Data**: Transition from simulated to actual user feedback for precise feature prioritization.
2. **Community Growth**: Invest in active moderation and events to boost early community engagement.
3. **Platform Expansion**: Prepare for quicker cross-platform development if demand spikes.
4. **Performance Tracking**: Establish metrics for AI suggestion acceptance and community activity.

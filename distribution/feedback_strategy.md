# User Feedback Collection Strategy for Atlas (ASC-027)

This document outlines the approach for collecting and analyzing initial user feedback during the public launch of Atlas as part of ASC-027. Feedback is crucial for identifying user needs and improving the application.

## Objectives
- **Gather Feedback**: Collect user opinions on usability, features, and issues.
- **Analyze Data**: Identify common themes or critical problems from feedback.
- **Iterate Quickly**: Implement fixes or enhancements based on user input.

## Feedback Collection Methods
1. **In-App Feedback Form**:
   - Integrate a simple form within Atlas for users to submit comments or report bugs.
   - Include fields for rating (1-5), category (bug, feature request, general), and description.
2. **GitHub Issues**:
   - Encourage detailed bug reports or feature requests via GitHub with templates.
   - Link to the Issues page from Atlas and the marketing website.
3. **User Reviews**:
   - Monitor reviews on the macOS App Store for qualitative feedback.
   - Respond to reviews to show engagement and gather more context if needed.
4. **Community Channels**:
   - Monitor social media (Twitter, Reddit) and planned community forums for unsolicited feedback.
   - Create pinned posts asking for specific feedback on new features.
5. **Beta Tester Surveys**:
   - Send targeted surveys to beta testers for structured feedback on specific areas.
   - Use tools like Google Forms for easy response collection.

## Analysis Process
1. **Aggregation**:
   - Centralize feedback from all sources into a single tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues or a spreadsheet).
   - Tag feedback by source, category, and priority for filtering.
2. **Prioritization**:
   - Rank issues by frequency (how many users report it) and severity (impact on user experience).
   - Focus on critical bugs first, followed by popular feature requests.
3. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Summarize findings weekly to identify trends (e.g., 'UI navigation confusing for 30% of users').
   - Share insights with the development roadmap for planning.

## Response and Iteration
- **Acknowledgment**: Respond to users who provide feedback, thanking them and outlining next steps.
- **Quick Fixes**: Deploy patches for critical issues within 48 hours if possible.
- **Roadmap Updates**: Adjust feature priorities based on feedback for upcoming releases.
- **Transparency**: Update users on GitHub or the website about implemented changes from feedback.

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Ensure feedback mechanisms are live (in-app form, GitHub templates).
- **Day 2-4**: Collect initial feedback, aggregate data, and begin analysis.
- **Day 5**: Summarize insights and initiate fixes or roadmap adjustments.

Total Estimated Time: 5 days (ongoing post-launch)

- **Licensing**: Clarify usage terms through appropriate licensing.

## Distribution Channels
1. **GitHub Repository**:

   - Provide detailed installation instructions in the README.md.
   - Use GitHub Releases for versioned downloads with release notes.
2. **macOS App Store**:
   - Package Atlas as a macOS application for distribution via the App Store.
   - Ensure compliance with Apple guidelines for submission.
   - Offer a streamlined installation experience for macOS users.
3. **Direct Download**:
   - Provide a direct download link from the marketing website for pre-built binaries.
   - Include checksums for security verification.

## Beta Testing Program
1. **Recruitment**:
   - Announce beta testing opportunities through the website, social media, and email newsletters.
   - Target a diverse group of users (developers, writers, project managers) with a cap of 500 initial testers.
2. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Set up a dedicated feedback form accessible from within Atlas.
   - Encourage bug reporting via GitHub Issues with predefined templates.

   - Offer early access to new features for beta testers.
   - Acknowledge active testers in release notes or on the website.
4. **Duration**:
   - Run the beta phase for 4 weeks, iterating based on feedback weekly.

## Licensing
- **Open-Source Model**: Release Atlas under the MIT License to encourage community contributions while allowing flexibility.
- **Documentation**: Include LICENSE file in the repository and a licensing section on the website.
- **Premium Support**: Plan for a future premium support or enterprise version with additional features.

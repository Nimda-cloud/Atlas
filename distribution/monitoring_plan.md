# Download Monitoring Plan for Atlas (ASC-027)

This document outlines the strategy for monitoring downloads and user issues during the public launch of Atlas as part of ASC-027. The goal is to identify and address bugs or crashes promptly to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Objectives
- **Track Downloads**: Monitor download statistics from GitHub and macOS App Store.
- **Identify Issues**: Detect bugs, crashes, or usability problems reported by users.
- **Rapid Response**: Prioritize and resolve critical issues to maintain user trust.

## Monitoring Tools
1. **GitHub Analytics**:
   - Use GitHub Releases page to track download counts and user engagement.
   - Monitor GitHub Issues for bug reports using predefined templates.
2. **macOS App Store**:
   - Access App Store Connect to view download metrics and user reviews.
   - Enable crash reporting to receive detailed crash logs from Apple.
3. **In-App Telemetry**:
   - Implement basic telemetry within Atlas to log crashes and errors anonymously.
   - Allow users to opt-in for detailed error reporting with consent.
4. **Feedback Channels**:
   - Set up a feedback form within Atlas linking to GitHub Issues.
   - Monitor social media mentions and community forums for user reports.

## Response Protocol
1. **Issue Triage**:
   - Categorize issues by severity (critical, major, minor) based on impact and frequency.
   - Use labels in GitHub Issues for organization (e.g., `bug`, `crash`, `ui`).
2. **Critical Issues**:
   - Address crashes or security flaws within 24 hours with hotfixes if necessary.
   - Communicate status updates to users via GitHub or social media.
3. **Major Issues**:
   - Resolve functionality bugs within 48-72 hours in scheduled updates.
   - Provide workarounds to affected users if immediate fixes aren't possible.
4. **Minor Issues**:
   - Batch fixes for UI glitches or non-critical bugs in weekly updates.
   - Document known issues in release notes for transparency.

## Timeline
- **Day 1-2**: Set up monitoring tools, ensure telemetry is active in released builds.
- **Day 3-5**: Actively monitor feedback channels, triage initial reports, and deploy fixes as needed.

Total Estimated Time: 5 days (ongoing during launch period)

## Communication
- Post regular updates on GitHub and the marketing website about resolved issues.
- Thank users for feedback to encourage continued engagement.
- Prepare a template for acknowledging critical bugs to streamline responses.
